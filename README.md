# Introduction
We develop a data-driven method for detecting subject-specific functional networks (FNs) while establishing group level correspondence. Our method simultaneously computes subject-specific FNs for a group of subjects regularized by group sparsity, to generate subject-specific FNs that are spatially sparse and share common spatial patterns across subjects. Our method is built upon nonnegative matrix decomposition techniques, enhanced by a data locality regularization term that makes the decomposition robust to imaging noise and improves spatial smoothness and functional coherences of the subject specific FNs.
